Description: library which exposes DSC Power Facilities to userspace via an API
 PAFLib is a IBM written library which exposes Power Architecture Facilities to
 userspace via an API. This includes the Data Stream Control Register Facility
 (DSCR) and the Event-Based Branching facility (EBB). Linux kernel 3.9 has
 exposed problem-state DSCR usage for ISA 2.06 (POWER7 - emulated) and ISA 2.07
 (POWER8 - in hardware). Linux 3.10 has exposed the EBB facility.
 .
 The Data Stream Control Register (DSCR for short) of POWER processors is used
 to control the degree of aggressiveness of memory prefetching for load and
 store.
