Description: library which exposes EBB Power Facilities to userspace via an API
 PAFLib is a IBM written library which exposes Power Architecture Facilities to
 userspace via an API. This includes the Data Stream Control Register Facility
 (DSCR) and the Event-Based Branching facility (EBB). Linux kernel 3.9 has
 exposed problem-state DSCR usage for ISA 2.06 (POWER7 - emulated) and ISA 2.07
 (POWER8 - in hardware). Linux 3.10 has exposed the EBB facility.
 .
 Event Based Branches (EBBs) are a feature which allows the hardware to branch
 directly to a specified user space address when certain events occur.
